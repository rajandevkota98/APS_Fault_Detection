#for data validation number columns, their datatypes, and the namme of columns are very important.
#we want to check that test.csv, train.csv and the base dataset are in same distribution
#we use ks test from scipy to validate
#Anamoly is my dataset
    #    high null values
    #    outliers
    #    categorical and numerical matching 
    # when levels are changed



    #concept drift --> the correlation between the target and dependent feature got changed
    #data drrift --> the distribution of the data got changed


    #p value less than 0.05 --> we reject null hypothesis of the ks test -->
    #Ho == data are uniformly distributed
    #H1== data are not uniformly distributed
